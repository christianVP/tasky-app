MongoDB Backup Architecture - Design Summary
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This document outlines the design decisions and architecture used to implement a scheduled MongoDB backup system in a Kubernetes environment, leveraging Azure infrastructure and GitOps practices.
ðŸ“‚ Components
1. MongoDB Instance
Host: Ubuntu 18.04 VM
Location: Azure VM provisioned via Terraform
Version: MongoDB 4.4
Access: Secured using SSH with a private RSA key
2. Backup Application
Container Image: cvp01/mongo-backup:latest
Language: Python with paramiko for SSH and Azure SDK for Blob Storage
Functionality:
Connects to MongoDB via SSH
Dumps the database
Compresses and uploads the dump to Azure Blob Storage
3. Kubernetes Cluster
Platform: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Deployment: Managed via Terraform
Namespace: backup
4. CronJob in Kubernetes
Resource: CronJob
Frequency: Every hour (0 * * * *)
RestartPolicy: OnFailure
Trigger: Also supports manual Job trigger for testing
5. Secrets Management
Kubernetes Secret: backup-secrets
Injected into Pod:
blob-conn: Azure Blob Storage connection string
id_rsa: Base64-encoded private RSA key used by paramiko
6. Terraform Infrastructure
Manages:
Azure Resource Group
AKS Cluster
Azure VM
Azure Blob Storage
K8s Secret and Namespace
ðŸ”§ Design Decisions & Tradeoffs
Choice
Justification
Alternative
Tradeoff
Use of CronJob
Built-in periodic execution in K8s, supports logging, retry, manual triggering
GitHub Actions / external scheduler
CronJobs are internal to K8s, no external trigger unless exposed
Secrets via K8s Secret
Secured and scoped within the backup namespace
ConfigMap (not secure), external vault
Simpler than full Vault setup, but less auditable
Terraform
Idempotent, declarative setup of entire stack
Manual setup or shell scripts
Requires Terraform knowledge and CI discipline
Private Key Mount
Container mounts key at runtime from secret
Bake key into container (bad)
Separation of secrets from container image improves security
Python + Paramiko
Simple SSH connection with file transfer
rsync, scp, or agent forwarding
Python gives more control but adds image size & dependency mgmt

ðŸš€ Deployment Process
Run terraform apply to deploy full environment.
Get MongoDB VM IP and update the mongo-backup-cronjob.yaml.
Apply the CronJob: kubectl apply -f mongo-backup-cronjob.yaml
Trigger test: kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mongo-backup mongo-backup-manual -n backup
ðŸ›¡ Security Considerations
RSA key is stored in a K8s Secret with read-only mount
Blob Storage credentials stored securely in same Secret
Pod has no elevated permissions or host mounts
ðŸ“ˆ Observability & Maintenance
Logs are accessible via kubectl logs
Failures trigger CrashLoopBackOff and show meaningful error traces
Rotation and pruning of old backups can be handled via Azure Lifecycle Management or cron in Blob Storage
ðŸ§­ Future Improvements
Replace Secret with HashiCorp Vault or Azure Key Vault
Add backup integrity verification step
Notify via email/Slack on backup success/failure
Schedule daily backup in addition to hourly delta
Auto-discover MongoDB IP via Terraform output or DNS
